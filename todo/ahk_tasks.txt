;WRITEME maybe I should generate a static page of the AHK Benchmarks page when we get IronAHK to where it runs pretty well. we should also keep track of version numbers and output to a db or ini or csv file... html file should look like: http://www.autohotkey.net/~Uberi/Scripts/Benchmarks/Benchmarks%20Combined%20%28shajul%29.html
