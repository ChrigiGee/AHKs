<h1>Multithreading</h1>

<p>Making your AHK do many things all at once</p>
<a href="index.html">Back to the home page</a>


<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Have you ever thought up a macro where you're doing more than one thing at once? You know, they start out innocently enough, but pretty soon you're monitoring three things at the same time, waiting to see if one of them pops up so that your macro can proceed. It seems that in the AHK IRC, that scenario happens pretty often (though not as often as the classic--"I want to make a macro for a game").
</p>
<h2>Fake multithreading</h2>
<p>
AHK does not support true multithreading. Honestly, it's probably better that way (we'll get to that later). True multithreading allows one set of actions to continue while another set of actions is continuing. Instead, AHK pauses the old thread so that the new thread can run, then once the new thread is finished, it resumes the old thread again. As we learn from the "Threads" doc, three items utilize threads: hotkeys/hotstrings, thimed subroutines, and menu items.
</p>
<h2>It's better that way</h2>
<p>
Now, why might it be better that AHK doesn't support true multithreading? Firstly, because programmers can't really follow the flow of execution when it is split up into multiple paths. The programming community has had enough of a difficult time migrating to a multi-threaded mindset that it seems most developers are pretty sure it just isn't the way that our minds think. Not to be a jerk, but the AHK community would have an even harder time with it, because many AHKers aren't programmers, so they lack the experience (whether that experience is from schooling or working in the field) to deal with such a conundruum.
</p>
<h2>The purpose of AHK</h2>
<p>
Secondly, in my book, AHK was made to help you get things done, even if they are sometimes a little bit ghetto. It fills those gaps where other applications have left out functionality. If an application has left out a couple of shortcut keys, you can add those in. It may required flashing through a couple of menus, but it still gets the job done. This is one of the reasons why AHK did not include Objects or real arrays in its' list of features. Because more is not always better.
</p>
<h2>Being clever</h2>
<p>
I know what you're asking now... you're wondering how you can do whatever it is that you want to do. Well, the odds are, the thing you want to do really isn't that hard: it just isn't! Usually, you just need to think about your situation logically. One person I was discussing this issue with wanted a WinWaitActive that would take two windows and wait for one of them to show up before continuing. If you're in this situation, just think about it a bit more: you can easily construct this on your own by being clever. Just build a while loop that checks IfWinActive, window #1 then IfWinActive, window #2. If either of those is true, then break out of the loop, and you're golden.
</p>
<h2>Ghetting the job done</h2>
<p>
In some cases, you'll have an actual situation where threads are required. In these cases, you'll need to Run, separateAHK.ahk... even though this is kinda ghetto, it gets the job done. If it doesn't, you're probably doing it wrong.
