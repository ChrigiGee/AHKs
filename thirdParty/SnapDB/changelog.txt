v1.1.8 - 2011-02-09
    + Passing in a CSV or TSV/TXT file via the commandline is now supported. 
      (Thanks, camerb)

v1.1.7 - 2011-02-09
    ! Fixed a small graphical glitch with the enable filter checkbox.

v1.1.6 - 2011-02-04
    * Changed how the clipboard-copy delimiter information is entered.  Please
      use the help button to see how the tokens work.  If you had spaces or tabs
      in your string, you will have to change it.

v1.1.5 - 2011-02-02
    + Snap DB is now Unicode capable.  Notes:
        # This version is supported by WinXP and up.  Older operating systems
          will need to use the SnapDB_ANSI.exe file instead.
        # Database files are read and written in UTF-8 format.
    + Added Ctrl-Shift-O hotkey for opening the Options dialog.
    * Changed the clipboard-copy delimiter to allow more than just one
      character.  (Thanks, Winkie)
    ! Fixed GUI glitches with Add/Update/Insert and Options dialogs.  (Thanks,
      Winkie)

v1.1.4 - 2011-02-01
    * Improved the matching logic when using the 'Run' buttons.  (Thanks,
      Winkie)

v1.1.3 - 2011-02-01
    + Added 'Run' and 'Clipboard' buttons to the Add/Update/Insert dialog.  The
      'Run' feature will attempt to execute data that meet the following
      criteria:
        # A file or folder e.g.: c:\path\to\my.exe, c:\path\to\image.png
        # A URI/URL with "://" in it e.g. http://www.site.com
        # 'mailto:' links e.g. mailto:skwire@dcmembers.com
    + Added row-copying capabilities.  You can set a custom delimiter to use
      under Options.  There are three ways to invoke this feature:
        # Edit menu.
        # Ctrl-C hotkey.
        # Toolbar button.
    + Added Ctrl-V hotkey to paste in a tab-delimited block.  This will allow
      you to copy rows with Ctrl-C and paste them in directly so long as you
      have 'Tab' set for the delimiter to use when copying rows (under Options).
    + Added 'Duplicate record' toolbar button.  (Thanks, Winkie)
    + Added "Sum columns" feature and toolbar button.  This feature will attempt
      to sum any columns containing numbers.  It will ADD two extra
      lines/records at the end of the list with the totals.  YOU are
      responsilble for deleting these lines or keeping them by saving.  If
      present, these new lines/records are considered in the next invocation of
      the 'Sum columns' feature.  In other words, Snap DB has no idea if those
      records are totals or regular data.  (Thanks, Beth UK)
    * Add/Update/Insert fields will now appear in the same order as the columns.
      (Thanks, Winkie)
    * Changed 'Options' toolbar icon.
    ! Duplicating a record now sets modified state to true.
    ! If you closed out of an Update window, you could no longer insert records.
    ! Stale data was kept after closing out of an Add/Update/Insert window. 
      (Thanks, Winkie)
    ! Filter drop-down list no longer resets when updating records, only when
      adding or deleting a column.  (Thanks, alexsan01)

v1.1.2 - 2011-01-28
    + Column orders are now saved per database.
    + "Convert row data to header names" added to the Edit menu.  This is useful
      after importing a CSV file.
    + Added custom CSV delimiter option under the Options dialog.  (Thanks,
      DeVamp)
    + Added "Import" toolbar button.
    + Added "Options" toolbar button.
    + CSV exports should be more adherent to the CSV standard with regards to
      double-quotes and commas within the data bits.
    + The column order for CSV exports didn't match up with the listview column
      order.  (Thanks, bob99)
    + Closing and saving a Snap DB database while in filter mode, and with a
      modified database, would result in Snap DB erroneously saving the filtered
      data view instead of the full, changed database.  (Thanks, TalksToPCs)

v1.1.1 - 2011-01-14
    + Added an "Edit record" menu item.  Also, the F2 hotkey will invoke this.
      (Thanks, Nikita)
    + Added a "Duplicate record" menu item.  Also, the F5 hotkey will invoke
      this. (Thanks, TalksToPCs)

v1.0.9 - 2011-01-12
    + Added "Append column" toolbar button.
    * Due to some screwy listview bugs, I changed the "Insert column
      before/after" menu items to a single "Append column" item.  This will add
      a column to the end of your current columns.  Once added, simply drag the
      column to the position you want.

v1.0.8 - 2011-01-12
    + Dropping CSV & TSV/TXT files on the list now works.  (Thanks, Stoic Joker)
    + Double-clicking a "non-row" area in the listview will trigger the "Add
      Record" dialog.  This is the area below the last record in the list. 
      (Thanks, Beth UK)
    + Added a "Sum column" option to the listview header menu.  This will
      attempt to sum any numbers found in the column, display the total and
      offer to copy the total to the user's clipboard.  (Thanks, Beth UK)
    * Improved the CSV/TSV/TXT import to automatically add new columns if
      needed. This applies to the pasting in of tab-delimited data as well.

v1.0.7 - 2011-01-12
    + Made the add/update/insert button default when adding a record so you can
      press Enter instead of having to click it.  (Thanks, Nikita)

v1.0.6 - 2011-01-11
    + The listview font face, style and color are now configurable under the
      'View > Options' dialog.
    + Made the "Load last database" feature an option under View > Options.
    + Option to keep a .bak backup after saving a database.  (Thanks, mouser)

v1.0.5 - 2011-01-10
    * Made Snap DB's save routine more robust and fault-tolerant.  (Thanks,
      mouser)
    * You can now pass .snp files to the SnapDB.exe and it will load them.
    * Snap DB now allows multiple instances of the viewer to run.
    + If the Last_File value is invalid, SnapDB will still automatically load
      the first .snp file found in the the SnapDB.exe folder.  (Thanks
      alexsan01)

v1.0.4 - 2011-01-10
    + Added an extra choice in the Filter dropdown called "Any column."  This
      will allow you filter using a string that matches any column.
    + Added ability to save chosen filter per-database.  This means, to make use
      of this feature, you will need to set the filter and then save the
      database file on each database you wish to use this on.  (Thanks,
      alexsan01)
    + Added ctrl-f hotkey to toggle Filter mode.  (Thanks, mouser)
    + Added View > Filter mode menu option.

v1.0.3 - 2011-01-07
    + Added tab-delimited text file import.
    + Added CSV file import.
    + Added ability to paste in tab-delimited data directly from the "Edit"
      menu.
    ! Last saved file didn't work from the "Recent" menu.

v1.0.2 - 2010-12-28
    + Last loaded database is automatically loaded after application startup.
    + Snap DB will automatically load an .snp file if both of the following are
      true:
        1) No config.ini file is present.
        2) There is a .snp file in the same folder as the SnapDB.exe file.
    + This allows you to bundle the SnapDB.exe file and a .snp database file
      together for easy viewing.  (Thanks, mouser) 

v1.0.1 - 2010-12-28
    ! Fixed toolbar glyph issue under Windows 7.  (Thanks, mouser)

v1.0.0 - 2010-12-26
    + First release.
