This is Camerb's repo of AHKs that make his life easier.
Maybe you can take parts of them and make your life easier,
too. This repo is open source, so have fun with the code
here. Don't try to sell this code, cause it's free, but if
this code just happens to help you be more productive and
it makes you some money, that's perfectly fine.

FYI: I run plain vanilla AHK (autohotkey.com). I don't run
any of the variants, like IronAHK or AHK_L, but I might
work with IronAHK if I move to Linux someday. All my current
machines are running either Win7 or WinXP.

Come to #ahk on irc.freenode.net to discuss or ask for help.
