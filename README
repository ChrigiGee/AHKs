This is Camerb's repo of AHKs that make his life easier. 
Maybe you can take parts of them and make your life easier, 
too. This repo is open source, so have fun with the code 
here. Don't try to sell this code, cause it's free, but if 
this code just happens to help you be more productive and 
it makes you some money, that's perfectly fine.

Come to #ahk on irc.freenode.net to discuss or ask for help.
